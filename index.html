        <h2>Overview</h2>

<p><a href="http://sqrrl.com">sqrrl</a> is a Big Data company that provides products for Apache Accumulo.</p>

<p>We are focused on Big Data challenges both in terms of scale and analytic complexity where data is constrained by legal, regulatory, or other restrictions. Our products promote data integration, secure information sharing, and data-driven solutions.</p>

<p>With sqrrl, Big Data becomes <strong>secure</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong>, and <strong>adaptable</strong> to a wide variety of data environments and analytical requirements</p>

<h3>Apache Accumulo</h3>

<p>Apache Accumulo™ is a sorted, distributed key/value store. It handles large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data as a robust, scalable, and real-time data storage and retrieval system. It can be integrated with any Hadoop deployment.</p>

<p>Apache Accumulo has three unique technical advantages over other comparable database solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>  <strong>Security:</strong> Fine-grained security controls allow organizations to control
data at the cell-level and promote a data-centric security model without 
degrading performance. Download sqrrl’s Cell-Level Security Data Sheet here.</li>
<li>  <strong>Scalability:</strong> Accumulo is proven to operate and perform at massive scale 
(i.e., petabytes of data) with low administrative overhead</li>
<li>  <strong>Adaptability:</strong> sqrrl’s solutions enable users to move beyond Hadoop batch 
processing and conduct a wide variety of real-time analyses, including information 
retrieval, statistical, graph, and visualizations across diverse data environments.</li>
</ul><p>For more information go to <a href="http://accumulo.apache.org/">http://accumulo.apache.org</a>.</p>
